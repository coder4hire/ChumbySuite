Copy all files except Other.zip to root folder of your USB - that will start your chumby with ChumbySuite as shell
Other.zip contains other files you'll possibly need to start Chumby Suite (QT libraries).
But most probably you'll have to replace them with libraries form your QT (for compatibility).
ChumbySuite binary should be copied to /bin folder of your USB.
